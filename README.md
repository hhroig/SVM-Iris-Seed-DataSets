### Iris Data Set

We deal with the classical Iris database due to R.A. Fisher. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. The aim of this report is to predict the class of an iris data in terms of some of the following variables:

1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. class: Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica

### Seeds Data Set


We deal with the problem of classifying three different varieties of wheat (Kama, Rosa and Canadian), from Seeds Data Set (check: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds>). There are several continuous covariates that correspond to measurements of geometrical properties of kernels from the seeds in study. These are: 

1. area A, 
2. perimeter P, 
3. compactness $C = 4*\pi*A/P^2$, 
4. length of kernel, 
5. width of kernel, 
6. asymmetry coefficient 
7. length of kernel groove.
